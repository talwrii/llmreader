# llmreader
The aspirations of an opensource llm tool to use while reading
If this project gets off the ground it will likely go through multiple rounds of iterations.

# The tool
Allow people to open a document and run queries will reading from the document from a variety of sources.
Important decisions. Wrap emacs initially? This tool is only for reading by will allow scripting.

# Product considerations
* Mouse usage is important.
* Dogfooding is important
* Installation is important
* Development environment will not be clean until it needs to be
* We will follow the literature
* We will have guis for configuration


# Temporary decisions
Wrap emacs - remove all it's features, keep code separated and then support other tools (including maybe gui tools)

# Architecture
* Speed of iteration is what it is all about.
* But the default mode will be good
* I should probably support macs.
* I want to know what people are using this for so I can improve this.

I will use a high level language (probably some of lisp) and then allow this to have multiple backends. I will probably target desktop initially because it is easier for people to devevelop and debug on this. 

I want people on wikipedia and in academia to use this tool.

# Downsides
Requiring people to have their own gpt keys will be an issue. I might provide a service that allows me to avoid having gpt keys like zotero.

# Money
To be clear, I might want to make some money from this... because being able to do things is good. And money has value.
Of course open source also has value - so the question is where the money to be made.

* Consulting
* Specializing
* Special reading features
* Domain specific extensions
* GPT-license while I keep copyright of the original version.

Obviously, this might influence your desire to contribute to this project or use it. But it's better that this be stated from the outset. 
If I'm not a good user, you can fork this project and you add least have a GPT variant that will live forever.

# Principles
I want to have principles, and get rewarded from having so. Principles do cost money however. 

Some principles:

* I won't hide competitors, I will be better than them, and endeavor to catch up. I won't necessary go out of my way to make you aware of competitors (as a research paper would demand) so read elsewhere
* Misleading. I will try not mislead people but I may decline to answer questions.
* Privacy. Your data might help me do things, I want to create a tool that is valuable. I will be clear when I am using data and what for
* Opensource. I don't believe open source is a right. I think it is entirely understandable that people would prefer to use open source software so as not to be taken advantage of. Is is also necessary to get rewards to create open source software.
* Niceness. I believe in niceness and politeness all things being equal
* Ideology. This project will to some extent be non-ideological. This of course will not always be possible, since there are some ideological assumptions about creating tools to help people read with llms

Want to help. I wouldn't necessary recommend it, this project exists in part for my self-interest. But if you find this tool useful and would like to fix something and have somone maintain some of your code - then feel free.

What you shouldn't do is feel like you will get something from contributing to this project - other that learning and haivng your code live.

# Ideology from the outset

I want to enable individuals to understand and interact in the world. Liberalism and non-safetyism is to some degree "baked-in" to this endeavour.

# Open versus closed

I see no issue with being closed about aims for this project but I will be clear that I am being closed.
